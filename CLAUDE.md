# CLAUDE.md — Tiny Kingdom Manager

A peaceful isometric kingdom simulation for the browser. Vite + TypeScript +
Canvas 2D, no framework, no runtime dependencies, **no asset files** — all art
and audio are generated in code.

Read `DESIGN.md` before proposing anything new. It is the original brief and the
statement of intent; most of it is deliberately not built yet. This file
describes what exists **today** and how to work on it.

## The one thing to internalise

This is not a strategy game with a nice skin. It is a **terrarium**. Every design
call bends toward "pleasant to leave running on a second monitor."

Concretely, that means:

- **Nothing is ever punishing.** No fail state, no death, no disasters. Running
  out of something makes a system *wait*, never collapse. If you add a mechanic
  that can hurt the player, you have got it wrong.
- **A large part of the sim earns nothing.** Villagers sit on benches, watch
  ducks, and stand about. Do not attach a stat to charming behaviour, and do not
  "optimise away" idle behaviour as wasted CPU. It is the product.
- **The economy is physical and watchable.** Goods only enter the shared store
  when somebody has carried them there. Never add a mechanic that teleports
  resources; if you cannot see it happen on the map, it does not belong.
- **Ecology stays mysterious, economy stays transparent.** Costs, recipes and
  job slots are all shown plainly. Wildlife spawn rules are never surfaced as
  numbers — only as observational hints in the wildlife panel.
- **Tone: sincere and understated.** Warm, plain, occasionally dry. Real UI copy
  from the game: *"Nobody remembers putting it there, which is impressive,
  because you did."* Not zany, not quippy, no exclamation marks.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit — strict, noUnusedLocals/Parameters on
npm run build        # typecheck + production bundle (~50 kB gzipped)
```

## Verifying changes — do not skip this

There are two harnesses, and they exist because this project has two whole
classes of bug that reading code will not catch.

### Simulation: `npm run sim`

```bash
npm run sim -- 600                    # 600 game-minutes (20 kingdom days)
TKM_DUMP=k.json npm run sim -- 600    # …and write the end state as a save file
npm run roundtrip -- k.json           # check a save survives serialisation
```

Runs the whole kingdom headless with no rendering, playing it roughly the way a
player would — placing buildings, staffing jobs, reacting to shortages — then
prints population, storage, every villager's experience, when each species was
first noticed, goals, journal, and consistency checks.

**Run this after any change to `sim/`, and always after touching `defs.ts`.** It
is how the economy was balanced and it catches things that look fine in code:
production chains that silently never run, one resource crowding every other out
of storage, wildlife arriving far too fast, XP curves that take 40 hours.

A run of ~600–1000 game-minutes is the useful range. Under ~300 you will not see
the bakery come online; over ~1200 the kingdom has plateaued and tells you little.

### Visuals: `scripts/shot.mjs`

```bash
npm run dev &
node scripts/shot.mjs                                     # default view
node scripts/shot.mjs http://localhost:5173/ out.png 6 "window.tkm.game.camera.zoomIndex = 3"
PRELOAD=k.json node scripts/shot.mjs http://localhost:5173/ late.png
```

Drives headless Chrome over DevTools, runs your JS in the page, captures a PNG,
and reports console errors. `window.tkm` exposes `{ game, ui }` so a snippet can
set the season, jump to night, open a panel, or arm a tool before the shot.

**Look at the picture.** Every visual bug in this build — roofs rendering as flat
plates, an invisible element eating clicks on half the toolbar, lit windows
bleeding through the building in front — was invisible in the source and obvious
in a screenshot.

`PRELOAD` seeds a save and loads it through the game's own code path rather than
reloading the page, because a reload lets the throwaway kingdom's
autosave-on-unload clobber the seeded slot.

## Where things live

```
src/
  types.ts            shared vocabulary; every entity shape is here
  core/util.ts        seeded RNG, value noise, small maths, id counter

  game.ts             clock, input routing, every player-facing operation
scripts/              simcheck.ts, roundtrip.ts, shot.mjs
```

**`src/sim/defs.ts` holds essentially all the tuning**: buildings (size, cost,
labour, job slots, recipes, upgrade curve, lights), job and trait definitions,
wildlife species with habitat weights and rarity, terrain movement speeds, the
XP curve, day length and season length. Balance changes almost always belong
here rather than in logic.

## How the simulation works

**The planner.** When a villager's plan is empty, `think()` builds a new one out
of concrete steps — `move`, `act`, `take`, `give`, `labour`, `sleep`, `effect`.
Every economic action is therefore something you can watch happen on the map.

Priority order: put down anything carried → sleep if it is their bedtime → eat if
hungry and bread exists → job work if it is work hours → leisure. Helpers fall
through a task ladder: supply construction sites, then build them, then restock
workshops, then clear finished goods, then hand-gather whatever is scarcest.

**Plans are transient and never serialised.** They can hold closures and derived
data freely. After a load everyone simply re-decides. Do not try to save them.

**Deferred consequences use `effect` steps**, not callbacks — `{ t: 'effect',
kind: 'batch' | 'sow' | 'reap' | 'eat' }`. That keeps steps plain data and
consequences exactly aligned with the end of the action that caused them.

**Claims prevent collisions.** `claim()` / `releaseClaim()` reserve a tree, a
farm plot, or a task so two villagers do not walk to the same one. Always release
through `releaseClaim` — it also clears the tile/plot flags. Plot claims are
keyed `farmId * 100 + slot`.

**Gluts, not jams.** `glutOf()` makes specialists stop when their own resource
exceeds 35% of storage capacity. Without it, woodcutters fill the barn and the
food chain starves. This is the mechanism that makes "the kingdom stalls but
never collapses" actually true.

**Wildlife.** `survey()` scores habitat across the map every 20 game-seconds from
terrain, nearby props, farm plots and season. Spawn chance is `0.45 / rarity³`,
cut to 0.3× again for a species' first-ever appearance, plus a per-species
cooldown. A species counts as *discovered* only once one comes within 7 tiles of
a villager or building — so ducks across the pond stay unlisted until somebody
wanders down there. Current pacing: commons day 1, deer ~day 9, snowy owl in the
first winter or two.

## How rendering works

**Pixel-perfect pipeline.** The world is drawn into an offscreen buffer at
exactly one canvas pixel per art pixel, then upscaled nearest-neighbour at an
**integer** scale (`round(zoom × dpr)`). This is what keeps the art crisp. Never
draw world content directly to the display canvas, and never introduce a
fractional scale.

**Ground is baked once** into a single map-sized canvas and blitted as one
image. Call `renderer.invalidateGround()` after any terrain or season change.

**Everything else is depth-sorted** by `x + y` per frame. Buildings sort from
their front tile minus a hair; farms sort from their *back* corner so crops draw
over the plot. Anything drawn outside that sorted pass will render on top of the
whole world — that was the lit-window bug.

**Sprites are procedural.** `sprites.ts` builds terrain, props, buildings and
crops into cached canvases from the season palette; `actors.ts` draws villagers
and animals per frame with `fillRect`, since they are tiny and each has its own
colouring. A season change simply re-bakes everything.

Building geometry: `isoWalls()` for the box, `gableRoof()` for a pitched roof
whose ridge runs along the grid x-axis, both filled column-by-column via
`fillPoly()` so edges stay hard. Buildings need visibly more wall than roof or
they read as flat plates. Sprites carry `padX` (roof overhang) and `rise`
(height above the footprint) — honour both when positioning.

**Lighting** is a separate buffer: ambient tint from `ambientTint()`, plus
radial sources composited `lighter`, then the whole thing multiplied over the
world. Anything that should glow at night must contribute to the light buffer;
drawing it bright in the world buffer alone will just get darkened.

## Gotchas that have already bitten

- **`#ui > * { pointer-events: auto }` outranks a bare class selector.** A hidden
  overlay with `.thing { pointer-events: none }` stays clickable and silently
  eats clicks on whatever is beneath it. Scope such rules as `#ui .thing`. This
  broke half the toolbar.
- **Vite dev serves `index.html` for unknown paths.** You cannot get a
  same-origin "blank" page from the dev server to seed `localStorage`; the app
  boots and autosaves over you.
- **Villagers must be in work hours to work.** A fresh game starts at `dayT`
  0.17 for exactly this reason — earlier and the founder idles through the
  intro instead of chopping wood.
- **`noUnusedLocals` / `noUnusedParameters` are on.** Removing an export means
  removing its now-unused imports too.
- **Emoji render unreliably in headless Chrome.** Do not judge icon-only UI from
  a screenshot; label things with text anyway, which is better UI regardless.
- **A tool with no on-screen feedback is undiscoverable.** Arming a mode must
  show a persistent hint saying what it does and how to stop (`.toolbar-hint`).

---

## Conventions

- Comments explain **why**, not what. Match the density already in the file.
- British-ish spelling in user-facing copy ("favourite", "colour"); code
  identifiers are whatever reads best.
- No new runtime dependencies without asking. The zero-dependency,
  single-bundle, no-asset property is deliberate and worth protecting.
- Prefer adding data to `defs.ts` over adding branches in logic.
- User-facing copy is part of the design. Write it in the game's voice.

## What is not built yet

All specified in `DESIGN.md`, all deliberately deferred:

expeditions · research / Knowledge tree · traveling merchants and visitors ·
domestic animals (chickens, sheep, cows, dogs, cats) · aging and retirement ·
land expansion into new chunks · daily / weekly goals · achievements and the
wider collections · villager requests

The scaffolding they hang off already exists — journal, discovery set, unlock
keys, per-building job slots, the goal list, the coin resource. Adding one of
these is mostly new data in `defs.ts` plus a system module, not surgery.

Also unbuilt and worth knowing: there is currently no Carpenter, Scholar,
Merchant or Animal Keeper profession (the `keeper` job id exists but nothing
uses it), and `coin` has no sink beyond a single goal reward.

## Scale reference

Map 40×40 · a day is 30 real minutes at 1× (20 day / 10 night) · 6 days a season,
24 a year · population cap 100, arriving roughly one per game-day early on ·
Master rank is ~10–15 real hours of dedicated work in one trade · storage is a
single shared pool fed by storage buildings.
